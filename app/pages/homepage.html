      <p>
        The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are
        <strong>fever, tiredness, and dry cough</strong>. Some patients may have
        aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea.
        These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Also the
        <strong>symptoms may appear 2-14 days</strong> after exposure.

              <strong>High Fever</strong> – this means you feel hot to touch on
              your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature).
              It is a common sign & also may appear in 2-10 days if affected.

              more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if
              you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual).

            <p>
              <strong>Difficulty breathing</strong> – Around 1 out of every 6
              people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
              difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.

      <p>
        Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose,
        sore throat or diarrhoea. These symptoms are usually mild & begin
        gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms &
        don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease
        without needing special treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill
        and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
        underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
        diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

          <h5 class="title">Wash your hands frequently</h5>
          <p>
            Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
            rub or wash them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why?</strong> Washing your hands with soap and water or
            using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your
            hands.

          <h5 class="title">Maintain social distancing</h5>
          <p>
            Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself &
            anyone who is coughing or sneezing. If you are too close, you get
            chance to get infected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray
            small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain
            virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
            including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

            Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why?</strong> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up
            viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your
            eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
            can make you sick.

          <p>
            Make sure you, & the people around you, follow good respiratory
            hygiene. This means covering your mouth & nose with your bent elbow
            or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why?</strong> Droplets spread virus. By following good
            respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses
            such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
